This is a front page of example site. The site uses StatiCL generator written in Common Lisp.

Here you can see how to separate content written in two languages. For example, posts in
Englush are available at [/blog/](/blog/) URL whereas posts in Russian can be found at
[/ru/blog/](/ru/blog/). Each blog has it's own rss feeds, but all pages are gathered into a
single [sitemap.xml](/sitemap.xml) file.

You can edit it as you want.
