(:p "This is an example of a page written using Spinneret. It's main advantage is an ability to use Lisp for HTML generation.")
(:p "You can execute any code to get data for the page - access a database or some API. Note that these actions will be performed
          during the build stage and site itself will remain static.")
(:p "Using Spinneret you can use any HTML markup. If you want to draw a red square, you just do it:")
